          During my time at Free University of Tbilisi, I had the opportunity to
          study under the Governance and Social Sciences programme. Through this
          programme, I gained a comprehensive education in a wide range of
          subjects, including humanities, social and political sciences,
          economy, law, management, and administration. The knowledge and skills
          I gained have equipped me with the tools I need to become a
          critically-minded leader with a strong civic consciousness. I
          appreciate that the programme's overarching goal is to prepare
          students for leadership positions in their chosen fields and promote
          civic engagement. The programme's focus on promoting critical
          thinking, leadership, and civic engagement aligns with my personal
          values and goals. Through my studies, I have learned how to become a
          successful analyst, leader, administrator, and consultant. I am
          confident that the knowledge and skills I have gained through the
          Governance and Social Sciences programme at Free University of Tbilisi
          have prepared me to make a positive impact in my community. I am
          excited to utilize the tools I have gained to become a leader in my
          field and contribute to society in a meaningful way.

          Colt Steele's Alogirthms and Data Structures course is a comprehensive
          resource that allowed me to master dozens of popular algorithms,
          including 6 sorting algorithms, and implement 10+ data structures from
          scratch. Through this course, I improved my problem-solving skills and
          became a stronger developer overall.

            The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!
          </a>
        </h1>
        <p>
          The course has given me a thorough understanding of how JavaScript
          really works behind the scenes, making me job-ready for any challenges
          that may arise in my career. Additionally, I have learned how to think
          and work like a developer, improving my problem-solving skills and
          workflows. I have gained an in-depth understanding of JavaScript
          fundamentals, including variables, if/else statements, operators,
          boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, and strings.
          Moreover, the course has provided me with a strong foundation in
          modern ES6+ concepts like arrow functions, destructuring, spread
          operators, and optional chaining (ES2020). I now possess knowledge of
          modern OOP concepts, such as classes, constructors, prototypal
          inheritance, and encapsulation, as well as complex concepts like the
          'this' keyword, higher-order functions, and closures.
